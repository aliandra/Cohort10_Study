** General Questions ** 
Explain the most complicated algorithm you’ve worked with…

** Bauer's interview with Mike at Annalect:** 
What’s the difference between NMF and LDA?  

Pick linear regression or random forests and explain how it works.  

What’s the difference between tree and random forest? (Random forests take random selections of both rows and columns, have lots of shallower trees, doesn’t overfit, less interpretable) .  

What's a lookalike model and how does it work?   


** Lisa interview with Mike at Annalect: **  

Draw Euclidian distance (straight line, ps Manhattan is like stairs or taxi)  
What other distance metrics are there?  

What’s the difference between Bayesian Regression and Regularized regression (for Lisa with Stats degree) (Bayesian has a prior??)  

What the matrices for NMF (non-negative matrix factorization) look like?  

What’s the difference between NMF and LDA?  
What is LSI vs NMF?  

What other methods of clustering are there, beside k-means?  

Describe what k-means clustering is.  

Pick linear regression or random forests and explain how it works.  

What’s the difference between tree and random forest? (Random forests take random selections of both rows and columns, have lots of shallower trees, doesn’t overfit, less interpretable)   

What is a prior and what is a posterior?  

What are probabilities that it’s going to rain given what it looks like now, draw the curve of it raining.  

What is the link function for logistic regression?  

What is a sigmoid function?  

What is logistic regression? Why do we need to use it?  

Explain exactly what a naive bayes classifier does and show what the x and y matrices look like in terms of the project you were working on.  

Explain how to calculate a cosign distance, after drawing what two vectors look like.  

What is the formula to scale data? What’s the purpose?  

What are the types of regularizations?  

What’s the difference and what’s the purpose of regularization?
